# n8n
its empty i can not put n8n on github bc It was the job of the company where I interned.

1. I have created an automatic notification project when a customer types in a notification into the system. It will send a notification to the admin's gmail and line by selecting to send only the customer's name, id, and the content information that the customer sent to the admin.

2. I created a project about automatically posting content to a Facebook page to reduce the time and effort spent thinking about content. By the content department or user typing the content topic that they want to post into the created LINE OA, for example, wanting to post content about PM 2.5 for 10 days, post every 11 a.m. of the day, the system will separate the text and take only the topic to generate through OpenAI without repeating it for a day and then save it in the DB, waiting to be posted when the time comes.Something like this
